				<p>Ensure that Vim won't try to be compatible with the
				now-archaic 1970s vi. It influences a lot of Vim behaviour.</p>
				
				<p>This is not strictly required when loading from
				<code>~/.vimrc</code> or <code>~/.vim/vimrc</code> – as Vim will
				automatically set it when loading from those files – but it's
				not set automatically when loaded as <code>vim -u
				test.vim</code> or <code>:source test.vim</code>.</p>
				
				<p>Most people won't load it like that, but a single line is
				easy enough to add and will avoid <em>very</em> confusing errors
				down the line.</p>

				changing the value resets many options. See 'nocompatible'.</p>

				<p>Vim ships with support for many languages, which is known as
					a 'filetype' in Vim jargon. A 'filetype' usually comes with a
					syntax file to control the syntax highlighting, but may also
					come with specific rules for indentation and may set
					settings specific for this 'filetype'.</p>

				<p>The default is to <em>not</em> use any of this though. This
					will enable detection of the filetype, which is usually done
					based on the filename's extension or the first line, and can be
					manually overridden with a 'modeline'.</p>

				<p>You almost certainly want to keep this.</p>

				<p>Vim's default behaviour when pressing the backspacing is somewhat
				peculiar, it won’t allow you to backspace to the previous line,

				<p>With this value you will be able to to backspace over everything
				in insert mode, which is how almost any other application
				behaves.</p>

				<p>By default Vim will always place the cursor in the first
					column when starting a new line. When 'autoindent' is enabled it
					will use the same indentation as the previous line, which is
					often what you want.</p>

				<p>Note that there are more options to control indentation:
					'cindent' and 'smartindent'. You usually want to leave those
					alone as they <strong>will</strong> cause confusing
					behaviour in many programming languages. A 'filetype' that
					benefits from these will usually set one of those options,
					or use a custom 'indentexpr'.</p>

				<p>If this is enabled Vim will display as much as the last line

				<p>There is another useful option for 'display' that I rather
